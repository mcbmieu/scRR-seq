# scRR-seq Code Repository

This repository contains the analysis codes for the **scRR-seq** study, including both **scRR-seq-DNA** and **scRR-seq-RNA** pipelines, as well as figure-specific plotting scripts.

## Pipelines Used

### 1. scRR-seq-DNA

For the DNA analysis, we followed the pipeline from:

- **Miura et al., Nature Protocols, 2020**  
- GitHub: https://github.com/kuzobuta/scRepliseq-Pipeline/blob/master/README.md

### 2. scRR-seq-RNA

For the RNA component, we used the ramdaq pipeline developed by RIKEN:

- **Hayashi et al., Nature Communications, 2018**
- GitHub: https://github.com/rikenbit/ramdaq

### 3. Haplotype-resolved/Allele-specific analysis

For haplotype-resolved/allele-specific analysis, we used the EMASE pipeline from:
- **Raghupathy et al., Bioinformatics, 2018**
- See: https://emase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
